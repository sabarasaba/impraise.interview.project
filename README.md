Impraise interview project
=====================

Based on Dan's https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate

### Usage

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ open http://localhost:3000
```

To run tests

```
$ npm test
```


### Things that could be improved

* Theres no visual feedback when a url is copied to the clipboard, ideally you would have some sort of `popover` or `notification` somewhere telling you that it got copied.
* Theres are no loading state when a url is submitted and the request is currently being fetched.
* There is no visual feedback if an error occurs when hitting the API (the app its actually dispatching an event that its being catched by the reducer though).
* Stats of each link are not updated in realtime, if the API supported WS it could've been something I could've done as well.
* The regex for validating url's is not awesome, and might not recognize some urls.
